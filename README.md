# Ranking

Ranking is a project that explores `learning to rank techniques` in the context of `artificial intelligence` to build a scalable, reliable and accurate recommender system.
The dataset used is `ml-100k`, from MovieLens, which consists of:
   - 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies.
   - Each user has rated at least 20 movies.
   - Simple demographic info for the users.
